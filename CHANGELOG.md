## 2.5.1 – Beginner-Friendly Onboarding Release

- Introduced a beginner-first documentation strategy:
  Layer 0 (human values and benefits) and Layer 1 (simple structure) before technical details.
- Added and aligned documentation such as onboarding, core guide, tier handbook,
  merit system, FreeMarket guide, ABS overview, USL/HSL guide, MaxROI guide,
  and lessons learned from the Copilot tests.
- Updated the AIGM core spec to version 2.5.1, integrating identity_core,
  cli_core, onboarding_layer, and joy_module as official components.
- Confirmed that existing 2.4.x style implementations remain compatible;
  this release is primarily a documentation and clarity upgrade, not a breaking change.
