AIGM – Human-Friendly Introduction

AIGM begins with human values, not structure.  
This solves the biggest adoption risk: if people feel the system is too technical or rigid,
they reject it before they understand it.

AIGM starts with:
- Joy
- Freedom
- Truth
- Simple, practical benefits for normal people

Only after these come:
- the tier system,
- the structure,
- the governance rules.

This order makes AIGM beginner-friendly and reduces fear of “complex systems”.
Clarity + joy = acceptance. Fear = rejection.

The Copilot tests revealed an important insight:
If an AI without context can misinterpret the repo,
humans without context will absolutely misinterpret it.
Therefore AIGM must provide clear onboarding FIRST.

This introduction is Layer 0 of AIGM documentation.
Layer 1 (simple structure) and deeper layers follow below.

# AIGM Standard

A lightweight, human-readable governance and collaboration model
for teams, individuals, and AI-assisted systems.

---

## PrimeSL – Primary Standard Layer (Top-Level Values)

Everything in AIGM must follow three priorities, in this order:

1. **Truth first** – decisions must align with reality, evidence and honesty.  
2. **Freedom of consent** – participation must be voluntary; opt-in and opt-out must always exist.  
3. **Respect for the Creator and nature** – systems may not destroy the environment or the humans they depend on.

Anything untruthful, forced or destructive is **invalid under AIGM**.

## AIGM Core – What the Standard Is

AIGM Core defines how responsibility, skill, trust and decision-making scale.

It exists to:
- make collaboration efficient,
- reward real skill instead of titles,
- maintain discipline without bureaucracy,
- prevent drift into politics, favoritism or chaos.

It is **not** a political movement, not a religion, not an elite club, and not an unreadable technical document.

It is practical by design.

## Tier Hierarchy (Human View)

- **Tier-∞** – Origin / standard creator.  
- **Tier-1337** – Standard definers & maintainers (3 votes can remove a peer).  
- **Tier-1** – Lead executors (require 3×1337 approval).  
- **Tier-2** – Practical solvers (execute tasks, generate merit).  
- **Tier-3** – Observers / feedback providers (3 matching observations escalate issues).  
- **Tier-4** – Unsynced public layer.

Responsibility increases with tier.

---

## Core Rules

- **Proof before merit**  
- **Tier-1 requires 3× Tier-1337 recommendations**  
- **Tier-1 may promote Tier-2 (+1 merit)**  
- Tier-1337 defines standards; Tier-∞ originates them  
- All decisions must respect PrimeSL

---

## Merit & Reciprocity

**Merit** = reputation for real contributions:
- solving problems,
- creating value,
- helping others,
- delivering consistent results.

A Tier-1337 member can be removed with **3 internal votes**;  
Tier-∞ may add/remove 1337 at any time.

---

## Task Flow

- Tier-2 may assign tasks to Tier-1 (AI-assisted triage).  
- Tier-1 delegates downward.  
- Tier-1337 ensures alignment with the standard.

---

## ABS & FreeMarket

ABS: read-only abstraction layer that ranks people by skill, trust and recent impact.  
FreeMarket: matches the right people to the right tasks and makes real performance visible.

---

## MaxROI Metrics

- financial_yield  
- wellbeing_yield  
- environmental_yield  
- customer_satisfaction  

Scaling is optional; one-person structures are fully valid.

---

## Repository Layout

- `spec/` – Core shell-style rules  
- `versions/` – Versioned deltas  
- `policy/` – USL/HSL  
- `abs/` – Abstractions (FreeMarket)  
- `standards/` – PrimeSL, AIGM Core, MaxROI  
- `docs/` – Human-readable docs  
- `examples/` – Implementation examples
