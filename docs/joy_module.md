AIGM Joy Module – The Emotional Fuel Layer

Joy is one of AIGM’s core components.
It is not decoration; it is functional.

Purpose:
- Joy increases creativity and problem-solving capacity.
- Joy reduces conflict and defensive behavior.
- Joy improves long-term engagement and collaboration.

Joy in AIGM:
- Systems must not produce fear or confusion.
- Onboarding must feel welcoming, not technical or bureaucratic.
- People must feel autonomy and safety (PrimeSL-aligned).

Joy is measured indirectly via:
- retention
- participation willingness
- project flow quality
- reduction in escalation events

Without joy, governance collapses into fear-driven behavior.
With joy, teams scale effortlessly.
