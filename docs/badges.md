AIGM Badge System

Badges are optional recognitions for positive actions.
They are NOT:
- merit
- certification
- tier-related
- power-related

Purpose:
- Encourage good actions without pressure.
- Celebrate contributions that don't fit merit metrics.

Rules:
- One badge per person per badge-type per year.
- Communities may create unlimited badge categories.
- Examples:
  - CacheFinderBadge (geocaching milestones)
  - MaxEffortBadge (exceptional voluntary help)
  - AbletonLaneBadge (inspired by Ableton’s design simplicity)

Badges are for joy, not governance.
