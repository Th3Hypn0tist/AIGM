AIGM Freedom Protocol

The Freedom Protocol ensures AIGM never becomes coercive.

Rules:
1. Full freedom of speech.
2. No moralizing or enforcement of personal lifestyles.
3. No forced participation.
4. No punishments for disagreement.
5. Work is opt-in; exit is always allowed.
6. A proposal is invalid if it violates consent (PrimeSL rule #2).

AIGM allows people to “do what works for them” (“Whatever floats your boat” principle)
as long as it does not violate another person’s freedom.
