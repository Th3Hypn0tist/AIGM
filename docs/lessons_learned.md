Lessons Learned – Copilot Interpretation Test

Purpose of this document:
The Copilot tests showed that misunderstanding happens easily
when documentation starts too technical.

Key lessons:

1. AIGM must be beginner-friendly.
   If documentation starts with hierarchy and governance,
   people feel intimidated and reject the concept prematurely.

2. Humans accept systems only when they understand the purpose.
   AIGM must begin with:
   - Joy
   - Freedom
   - Truth
   - Simple benefits for normal people

3. Documentation must have two layers:
   Layer 0 – Human explanation (values, purpose, benefits)
   Layer 1 – Simple structure (what AIGM is and how it works)
   Only after these can deeper layers appear.

4. Without a friendly entry point, beginners fear the system.
   Fear → rejection.  
   Clarity + joy → acceptance.

5. Copilot proved the principle:
   If an AI without context misinterprets the repo,
   humans without context will absolutely misinterpret it.
   Therefore clear onboarding is mandatory.

6. AIGM must present human values FIRST and governance SECOND.

This is now part of the official AIGM documentation strategy.
