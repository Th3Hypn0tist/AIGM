AIGM Onboarding – Beginner-Friendly Guide

Overview:
AIGM is designed to help humans collaborate better with each other and with AI.
To make this easy for beginners, AIGM onboarding has two layers:

Layer 0 – Human Explanation:
- Why AIGM exists
- Why it makes life easier
- Why it is designed around joy, truth, and freedom
- What benefits a normal person gets from using it

Layer 1 – Simple Structure:
- What AIGM is
- What the tiers do
- What merit means
- Why FreeMarket is only a helper, not a controller

Key Insights (Lessons Learned from Copilot):
1. AIGM must begin with human values, not technical terms.
2. People accept systems only when they understand the purpose.
3. Beginners fear systems that appear too complex or authoritarian.
4. Clarity and joy reduce resistance and increase adoption.
5. The Copilot misinterpretation confirmed that clear onboarding is mandatory.
6. Therefore AIGM always presents human values FIRST, structure SECOND.

Why this matters:
If onboarding fails, the entire system fails.
If onboarding succeeds, AIGM becomes intuitive, friendly, and low-friction.

The goal:
Anyone should understand AIGM in under 3 minutes,
without feeling intimidated or judged.
