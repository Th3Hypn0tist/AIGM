# AIGM – Artificial Intelligence Governance Model
**Status:** Emerging Open Standard (Public Iteration Phase 1)

The AIGM is an open, iterative governance model for AI-human collaboration.
It defines explicit operational tiers (∞, 1337, 1–4) and synchronization principles
for ethical, modular, and verifiable AI deployment.

Unlike existing frameworks (OECD, NIST, ISO, EU AI Act),
AIGM functions as a meta-standard — designed to integrate,
not compete. It provides a unifying resonance layer
across all governance systems.

AIGM is currently under public review and live development on GitHub.
